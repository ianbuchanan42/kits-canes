                    <p>
                      The Ballad of Kit Rosefield tells, with humor, how Kit's
                      Canes came about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After a quad accident on our apple ranch, I began walking
                      the orchards with an apple branch sucker as a makeshift
                      cane — my "snake stick" against rattlesnakes. Over time, I
                      refined it: stripping, sanding, sealing, and finishing.
                      Encouraged by a friend who made walking sticks, I created
                      my first apple wood mobility canes as gifts for my brother
                      Gary, my therapist friend Mike, and myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Word spread quickly at Lighthouse for the Blind and
                      Visually Impaired, where the canes became a hit. Soon I
                      was making them for trainers and friends — and Kit's Canes
                      was born.

                    <h2>The Apple Orchard</h2>
                    <p>
                      Rosefield Orchards has been in my family since 1970.
                      Nestled in a canyon along the North Fork of the Tuolumne
                      River at 4,500 ft elevation, our orchard yields a harvest
                      every 4–5 years. Those harvests have always been a
                      community effort, with fruit shared through food banks,
                      soup kitchens, and senior centers. Along the way we've
                      made applesauce, cider, and other goodies — all labors of
                      love.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Apple Suckers</h3>
                    <p>Wondering what an apple sucker branch is?</p>
                    <p>
                      When fruit trees are pruned, small shoots (suckers) grow
                      where cuts were made. While they drain energy from fruit
                      production, when left to grow they make excellent walking
                      sticks and cane material. You might call it making
                      lemonade out of lemons.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Making the Canes</h3>
                    <p>
                      Each cane goes through about 22 steps over three months:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Harvesting and stripping sucker branches</li>
                      <li>Curing for 2–3 months</li>
                      <li>Sanding with multiple grits</li>
                      <li>
                        Sealing and painting with multiple coats (each coat
                        carefully cured)
                      </li>
                      <li>Adding clear urethane for durability</li>
                      <li>Applying black rubber handle material</li>
                      <li>Preparing cane ends for proprietary tip adapters</li>
                      <li>
                        Finishing with handle straps, brass eye screws, and
                        washers
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      Just like our orchard harvests, these canes are truly a
                      labor of love — and my artistic outlet.

                            His work explores the intersection of vision, touch,

                            experience with Charles Bonnet syndrome, where his
                            central vision is filled with undulating clusters of
                            pink, red, and yellow-green dots that sparkle, along
                            with pink-red spirals that look like old-fashioned

                            Kit's mantra: "Just say, 'Thank you.'" reflects his

                            Kit collaborates with Fully Tactile Art SF, a
                            non-profit organization dedicated to creating free
                            public art spaces that engage not only the sense of
                            touch but all the senses.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This collaboration aligns perfectly with Kit's work
                            in creating tactile, accessible art experiences. The
                            organization transforms how people interact with
                            art, providing unique environments where artists can
                            re-imagine how their work is experienced and
                            enjoyed.
